Building
--------------------
To build this project, simply

    mvn install

Replication/consensus API
--------------------
This is an implementation of the Raft consensus protocol. It can replicate arbitrary data between several servers. Example usage may be found in the tests in project module __c5-general-replication__.

Log-reading utility
-------------------
Also provided is a utility for reading the logs generated by the replicator; the code for this utility is in module __cat-olog__,
and it may be run from the command line as:

    cat-olog/bin/cat_olog.sh <log file name>

Troubleshooting
--------------------
On Mac OSX:

    export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`

More documentation
--------------------
For more information about the code and package structure, please see the package-info.java files in the __c5-replicator__ module in package c5db.replication; and in the __c5-replicator-log__ module in package c5db.log, respectively.
